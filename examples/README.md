# Examples [[中文]](./README_cn.md)

This directory contains a range of examples in ESP-Skainet projects. These examples exist to demonstrate the functionality of ESP-Skainet and to provide the source codes that can be copied and adapted to during the development of your projects.

# Example Layout

The following two examples are currently available:

- get_started

  > Support English and Chinese

  This example is a project template with four speech command words built-in.  
 Users can refer to the [readme](./get_started/README.md) of this example to understand the specific use and precautions of speech command recognition.

- garbage_classification
 
  > Support Chinese

  In this example, we use wake word detection and speech commands recognition to build an off-line garbage sorting example, which can suggest the type of a garbage according to the present classification when a specific garbage name is identified. For example, if the board hears and identifies “卫生纸” (toilet paper), it plays “干垃圾” (residual waste), which indicates “卫生纸” (toilet paper) should be sorted as “干垃圾” (residual waste).

- noise_suppression  

  This example shows how to use the Noise Suppression (NS) algorithm. The example takes the audio data collected by the microphone through noise suppression to obtain 16KHz, 16bit, mono audio data, and immediately outputs the     noise-reduced data. So when the user inserts the earphone on the AUDIO_OUT interface of the LyraT_Mini development board or the PHONEJACK interface of the ESP32-LyraT V4.3 board, the user can hear the processed sound. The user can select whether the noise suppression is turned on by pressing the "Mode" button on the LyraT_Mini development board or ESP32-LyraT V4.3 board.

# Using Examples

The steps to build a new example is no different from building any other project:

* Follow the Getting Started instructions to create a "get_started" example.
* Navigate into the directory of the new example you'd like to build.
* Run `make menuconfig` to configure the example.
* Run `make` to build the example.
* Follow the instructions printed in the log to flash, or run the `make flash` command.
